      <h5>Biography</h5>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Benjamin Aggerbæk is a composer, singer, and passionate
          innovator resident in Copenhagen.</p>

          <p>His four albums cover genres from folk music to jazz;
          from a pure solo with Aggerbæk’s vibrant voice and acoustic
          guitar to albums based on big bands with full wind and
          string sections. Benjamin Aggerbæk is a master of both
          roles: he performs alone as a genuine singer/songwriter as
          well as a modern jazz crooner in front of his 15-piece
          orchestra Aggerbæk Orchestra in an exciting and very
          personal mixture of charming swing and classical
          fervour.</p>

          <p>Aggerbæk has many ongoing projects: several songs from
          his latest album are among the most aired on Danish Radio’s
          jazz channel, and you can meet him once a week on one of his
          songwriter-open-stages or at one of DMF’s (Danish Musicians
          Union) many enterprises. In 2012, Benjamin received the DMF
          ‘Passion Award’ for innovation and in 2008, the North
          Zealand jazz festival "New Note" Festival's honorary award
          for original music on his debut album "Back In Town", and
          for his work promoting the singer/songwriter scene in
          Copenhagen.</p>

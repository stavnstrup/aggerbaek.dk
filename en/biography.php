      <h5>Biography</h5>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>In recent years, Benjamin Aggerb&aelig;k's music has
          brought him around many parts of the world and back again to
          his native Copenhagen.&nbsp; Now he is ready with his second
          album, which is, in many ways, the portrait of a musician's
          life on the road.</p>

          <p>Since 2006 Benjamin Aggerb&aelig;k toured in New York
          City no less than 7 times, with 11 straight shows in
          2009.&nbsp; In 2008 Benjamin also toured Austin, Odessa and
          Chicago.&nbsp; Add to that the three weekly
          songwriter-open-stages Benjamin organizes in Copenhagen, all
          the other concerts at home and abroad, and the you begin to
          get the picture of Benjamin's life as a man on the move.</p>

          <p>Despite this hectic schedule, there was enough time in
          the summer of 2009 to record a new album: &quot;My Oh
          My&quot;.&nbsp; Travel the world with Benjamin as he takes
          you from the blues in St Petersburg in Russia to moonlit
          nights in Austin, Texas, with cheerful songs of sweet love
          to dark ballads of broken hearts.</p>

         <p>In 2008, Benjamin received the North Zealand jazz festival
         &quot;New Note&quot; Festival's honorary award for original
         music on his&nbsp; debut album &quot;Back In Town&quot;, and
         for his work promoting the singer/songwriter scene in
         Copenhagen.</p>

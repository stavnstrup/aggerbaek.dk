      <p><strong>Jazz Special - #112 (Dec. 09)<br>
      Henrik Wolsgaard-Iversen:</strong><br>
      &ldquo;The concept spans many angles and
      colors, from the simple folk/blues to the more voluptuous
      orchestrations with a full horn section and extra strings. But
      it is the singer and his songs - it's Aggerbaek all along - that
      fascinates so deeply... fine sounds from [Alexander] Kraglund
      and Kasper Bai [on guitar], who also arranged the album so
      beautifully... &rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>Nation-wide Danish newspaper Information -
      22-12-09<br> Peter H. Larsen:</strong><br>
      &quot;One cannot
      listen to &ldquo;My Oh My&rdquo; without having
      fun...[Aggerbaek] is a huge vocal talent. &quot;</p>

      <p><strong>Nation-wide Danish newspaper Politiken -
      03-12-09<br> Henrik Palle:</strong><br>
      &ldquo;[Aggerbaek] plays
      his own songs, which he performs with great feeling, aided by
      varied and beautiful graces from Kasper Bai, who plays guitar in
      Aggerbaek's ensemble... Aggerbaek's vocals possess a great
      fervor and stands up to the very imaginitive musical background
      that gives the songs such a large and full expression...Charming
      and absolutely endearing .&rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>Regional newspaper Aarhus Stifttidende 10-11-09<br>
      Thomas Bj&oslash;rnsteen:</strong><br>
      &ldquo;Absolutely crucial is Aggerbaek's charming voice that
      both nestles in softly and vibrates intensely ... you believe in
      the little stories about love, oblivion and darkness. Elegant
      and persuasive. &rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>JazzNyt by Niels Overg&aring;rd -
      28-12-2009<br> Jazznyt.blogspot.com</strong><br>
      &ldquo;It is
      all too rare that Danish singers make original and new jazz
      music, but it is not only because Aggerbaek is one such rare
      fish that he has made one of the year's best records...the ease
      of the music, along with the delicate originality and good voice
      should be enough to give Benjamin Aggerbaek a
      breakthrough.&rdquo;</p>

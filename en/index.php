<p><a href="audiovideo.php">Videos from the release concert</a></p>



<p>March, 2013</p>

<p>Hello Everybody</p>

<p>Great News. I have finally found a release date for my next double
album “Heartbeat”!  The release concert will be at Huset i Magstræde,
Planeten, Tuesday April 16th at 19.00! AND it will be with my 16
people orchestra – HUGE! I truly hope you will make it that day and
also find your time to enjoy the double album.</p>

<p>Also great that I have signed a contract with Calibrated Music and
I'm looking forward to being an artist on that label.</p>

<p>Here’s the story behind “Heartbeat”:</p>

<p>It was a late night session at Face Plant Studios in the middle of
October 2011.  A big bottle of whiskey was making the rounds as
creative energy buzzed and intensified, finally forming into the solo
recordings. I kept listening to that studio solo session while
we were working on the orchestrated version back in Denmark - I was
drawn to how fragile and raw the sound was. I decided, then, to make
this a double album, presenting side-by-side "One Night in an Austin
Studio" and "Heartbeat Orchestrated", with all their differences and contrasts.
You'll hear the solo recordings just as we made them, unfiltered,
untouched by my own worries about perfection. The orchestra versions
of the songs have been given such depth by Kasper Bai's brilliant
arrangements and the great collaboration of my Quintet; you can hear
the passion that everyone poured into this labor of love.  I hope you
enjoy both albums as much as I enjoyed making them.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening, Benjamin Aggerbæk</p>

<p><strong>Jazz Special - #112 (Dec. 09)<br>
Henrik Wolsgaard-Iversen:</strong><br>
&ldquo;The concept spans many angles and
colors, from the simple folk/blues to the more voluptuous
orchestrations with a full horn section and extra strings. But
it is the singer and his songs - it's Aggerbaek all along - that
fascinates so deeply... fine sounds from [Alexander] Kraglund
and Kasper Bai [on guitar], who also arranged the album so
beautifully... &rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Nation-wide Danish newspaper Information -
22-12-09<br> Peter H. Larsen:</strong><br>
&quot;One cannot
listen to &ldquo;My Oh My&rdquo; without having
fun...[Aggerbaek] is a huge vocal talent. &quot;</p>

<p><strong>Nation-wide Danish newspaper Politiken -
03-12-09<br> Henrik Palle:</strong><br>
&ldquo;[Aggerbaek] plays
his own songs, which he performs with great feeling, aided by
varied and beautiful graces from Kasper Bai, who plays guitar in
Aggerbaek's ensemble... Aggerbaek's vocals possess a great
fervor and stands up to the very imaginitive musical background
that gives the songs such a large and full expression...Charming
and absolutely endearing .&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Regional newspaper Aarhus Stifttidende 10-11-09<br>
Thomas Bj&oslash;rnsteen:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Absolutely crucial is Aggerbaek's charming voice that
both nestles in softly and vibrates intensely ... you believe in
the little stories about love, oblivion and darkness. Elegant
and persuasive. &rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JazzNyt by Niels Overg&aring;rd -

&ldquo;It is
all too rare that Danish singers make original and new jazz
music, but it is not only because Aggerbaek is one such rare
fish that he has made one of the year's best records...the ease
of the music, along with the delicate originality and good voice
should be enough to give Benjamin Aggerbaek a
breakthrough.&rdquo;</p>
